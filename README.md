# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the logged in user from the clothing items they have added to the backend server.

## Functionality

The WTWR app has the following functionality ->

- Register a new user on the backend
- Authorized a registered user
- Add new clothing items to the backend for a authorized user
- Show all clothing items for the current weather conditions
- Swap between a user's preferred measuring system -- Imperial and Metric
